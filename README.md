# ∫ Integral RestEasy

A replacement for `tapestry-resteasy` by [Tynamo](https://github.com/tynamo/tapestry-resteasy) supporting the latest RestEasy version (3.0.19.Final) and a nice way to provide custom headers in the pipeline.

## Why?

We love to use the latest and greatest software available. And we really love Tapestry 5.4, but the RestEasy plugin by Tynamo is a little outdated an we wanted to expand it for our usage. So we updated the dependencies and added some Java 8 and created an _almost_ drop-in replacement.

## Usage

NOTE: This library isn't released yet on jcenter etc.!

### `build.gradle`:
```groovy
respositories {
  jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    compile "net.netzgut.integral:integral-resteasy:0.0.1"
}

```

Now just import `ResteasyModule.class` in your app module and you're good to go.

## Gradle task uploadArchives

To upload the archives you need to set some project properties:

- snapshot_repository
- snapshot_repository_username
- snapshot_repository_password

The fallbacks are empty strings, so you can build etc. without gradle failing instantly.
